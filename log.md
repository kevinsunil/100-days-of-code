# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### Starting my 100 days challenge

**Today's Progress**: Fixed my Repo for the challenge started working on an assignment from the odin project

**Thoughts:** As it was just a simple html-css landing page I didn't go much detailed into css. Hoping to try out a few css frameworks with simple pages like this for the first few days.
